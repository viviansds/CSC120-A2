Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I was initially confused about what we were supposed to do and felt overwhelmed by the different files. So I spent some time reading carefully and trying to understand what was going on line by line. It was useful to consider what kinds of objects are at stake and what they are becoming. For example, because I didn't understand the nested dictionary at first, writing the refurbish code was difficult because I couldn't modify the nested value with the correct notation syntax. It was also critical to comprehend the details of the naming system. For example, item_id, itemID, and computer_id. So I spent a lot of time tracing each name and incorporating a lot of print() statements to help me understand what values are behind each name and how they are related. Finally, I debated whether the itemID and inventory should be global variables or attributes. Then I decided to put them in the constructor because, ideally, we can have multiple instances of the class, each with a different inventory and ItemID. Although this assignment did not require us to create more than one resale shop, this decision will undoubtedly strengthen the entire code. Overall, I haven't coded in Python in a long time, so this assignment was a great refresher for me as we transition to object-oriented programming in Java.
